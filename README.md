# FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Client SDK

This is a production-ready implementation of the Device component defined in
[FIDO Device Onboard Spec](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/FDO/fido-device-onboard-v1.0-ps-20210323/)
published by the FIDO Alliance. Appropriate security measures should be taken for storing the device
credentials while porting this to different platforms.
