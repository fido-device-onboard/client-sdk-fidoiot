# FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) Protocol Reference Implementation (PRI) Manufacturer
The FDO PRI Manufacturer generates a device certificate based on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as part of the Device Initialization (DI) protocol, enabling a seamless Ownership Transfer of the device to the new owner.

## DI.AppStart
- This is the first message sent by the device to start the Ownership Transfer.

- The message is sent to the FDO PRI Manufacturer in the manufacturerï¿½s premises with a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

- The FDO PRI Manufacturer uses this CSR to generate the Device Certificate and passes the Device Certificate on as an
  authentication mechanism for the device using the ECDSA public/private key cryptography.

## Supported Configuration
```
make DA=ecdsa256
```

## Known Limitations
1. DI.AppStart specifies a particular format of the message in which the CSR is one of the components.
   Another component is the `serial_number`. FDO expects the device user to write their own mechanism
   to generate this `serial_number`.
   As a reference:
   ```
   FILE: lib/m-string.c
   DeviceMfgInfo Format: [<key type id>, <serial number>, <model number>, <csr>]
   key type id  : ECDSA256 = 10 and ECDSA384 = 11
   serial number: To be filled
   model number : Can be an empty string
   csr          : ECC-based Certificate Signing Request

   ```

2. The ECDSA key is read from the filesystem. Refer to [Security Implications](security_implications.md)

3. Currently, the Device Attestation (DA) mechanism is independent of the Owner Attestation (OA) mechanism as
   shown in the following table:
   ```
    ---------------------------------------
   |Device Attestation | Owner Attestation |
   |---------------------------------------|
   | EPID              | RSA2048RESTR      |
   | ECDSA NIST P-256  | RSA2048RESTR      |
   | ECDSA NIST P-384  | RSA2048RESTR      |
   | EPID              | RSA 3072-bit key  |
   | ECDSA NIST P-256  | RSA 3072-bit key  |
   | ECDSA NIST P-384  | RSA 3072-bit key  |
   | EPID              | ECDSA NIST P-256  |
   | ECDSA NIST P-256  | ECDSA NIST P-256  | <--
   | ECDSA NIST P-384  | ECDSA NIST P-256  |
   | EPID              | ECDSA NIST P-384  |
   | ECDSA NIST P-256  | ECDSA NIST P-384  |
   | ECDSA NIST P-384  | ECDSA NIST P-384  | <--
    ---------------------------------------
   ```
   The CSR data is filled as part of `DI.AppStart` based on Owner Attestation.
   So, essentially, it is only filled for
   ```
   Owner Attestation = ECDSA
   ```
   Marked combinations in the preceding table are supported.
